# 15PuzzleProcessing

Or rather, `sketch_finalProject`.

## History

The original code was written in 2016. This is shown by the somewhat crude
nature of it, such as lack of proper documentation (comments on variables) and
"inefficiency" derived from improper calling of functions.

The code was revised around early 2018.
